## Purpose
Generally, the purpose of a portfolio is so that is acts as a companion for a resume. It is a place where developers can showcase their work to potential partners or workers. That's what the purpose of this portfolio was. 
## Functionality/ Features
HTML5 and CSS was used for this portfolio. All the HTML files were all linked to one stylesheet. Overall, portfolio website include a home page, an about page, a study/ work history page and a contacts page. The portfolio included links to social media accounts, and also included a pdf of my resume. The navbar had a hover effect to indicate which option the user's mouse was on. 
### HTML document
The HTML document included sections which had separate id's in order to style them differently. The navbar and the headers are prime example of this. One of the main reasons this was done is so that the different section can be styled differently. The HTML document included the regular head and body. The portfolio included links and images which were linked from a different folder. The navbar was made up of a un-ordered list, which was styled.
### CSS sheet
Since in the HTML document the each sections had different id's and div classes, it was easier to style them separately. Almost everything was styled in order to fit a certain theme.
