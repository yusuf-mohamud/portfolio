# Theme

## Colour
For the overall theme of the portfolio, maroon and light blue were the two main/primary colours. This is becasue these colours compliment eachother well. 

## Font
Also, the font family which was utilised was arial, san-serif. This font was chosen as it gives the potfolio a modern feel, rather than fonts like 'Times New Roman'.
